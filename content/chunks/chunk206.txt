Beached
Cold Autumn Nights
The party is stuck on the sandbar. The cold northern winds stop them from resting.
The party uses torches, rations, and arrows to create a bonfire. The party uses a stabling mechanism from Thoradin's Shield, ropes, and Theobald's Immovable Rod to raise it from the rising seawater.
Adikia casts Animal Messenger to relay a message to Gandour Ironfleet.
Kiris casts Binding Ice to create a barrier from the seawater.
An Enemy Anemone
The party wakes up to find three griffons circling the sandbar. Upon checking, they spot a Giant Anemone trying to eat a dead griffon.
The party is threatened by the Giant Anemone. They successfully kill it, and they disperse the opportunistic griffons.
Polymorphin' time
Adikia proposes to Polymorph Adeena into a sperm whale. Dorfir Embersense and Fiamil Underwood excitedly agree.
Adikia casts Polymorph again to refresh its duration. The party lands on the coast 10 miles from Midkip.
Adikia casts Polymorph on a thrilled Dorfir Embersense. She turns him into a T-rex. Kiris, Fiamil and Splix ride on the polymorphed professor. Adeena and Thoradin cast Find Steed. Arc and Noah walks.
Along the way, the party spots the Bloated Dragon. They manage to catch its attention, thanks to a loud roar from Dorfir Embersense.
The Bloated Dragon descends, and Gandour Ironfleet meets them. He explains that the party was gone for nearly two days. The party concludes that entering the Library must have induced another temporal anomaly.
The party notices that Gandour is hiding something. Gandour, upon being questioned, tells the party that they must not judge him. They ascend on the Bloated Dragon's lower deck and see Janna Furwish waiting for them.
"Lucky that you are all alive..."
