In the Dead of Night
A Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed
As [Kiris and Adikia are walking on the smog-covered bridge to Drakon, they see a hooded figure in front of them. The figure asks:
"Where's your friend?"
The smoke clears, and the figure is revealed to be Kayriel.
Adikia and Kiris try to dissuade Kayriel from attacking, but they fail. A group of hired thugs obstructs the path behind them. Adikia and Kiris attack Kayriel.
Adikia drops to zero hit points; Nokia turns into stone and falls from the sky, breaking upon impact. 
Adikia dies as Kiris is too late to save her. Kiris casts Dimension Door to escape the encounter with the dead body of Adikia.
Kiris could not retrieve the Aureate Rapier. The Aureate Rapier is now lost.
Hit and Run
Arc surveys the surroundings of Ironfleet Compound. He perceives someone following him.
Arc confronts the man following him. It turns out to be Kayriel. Kayriel asks,
"Where is she?"
Arc attacks Kayriel. After a brief but deadly scuffle, Kayriel comes out with a significant advantage. Arc manages to escape to the Ironfleet Compound.
A Sacrifice to an Oath
Adeena attacks Kayriel. Adeena lands several blows to Kayriel. Kayriel manages to hit back.
"At least you let me hit you."
Adeena punches Kayriel, leaving him unconscious. Adeena surveys the arena and sees eight individuals, who she is sure to be Followers of Yekora, emerge from the shadows. They point their crossbows at Adeena and Kayriel.
At the last moment, Adeena retrieves the Evershift and drives it into Kayriel's chest. Adeena takes four hits from the incoming crossbow bolts. A scream from a woman reverberates within the arena.
"He's dead!"
The scream prompts Thoradin to enter the arena.
Thoradin attempts to revive Kayriel by casting a Revivify spell. Kayriel opens his eyes and looks at Adeena:
"Make my sacrifice worth it."
Kayriel dies.
