Description
As son of King Agustus Kyp, Azir is heir to the United Kippian throne. His brash attitude, easygoing demeanor, and boastful proclamations made him unpopular with the nobles of the royal court. However, his morale-boosting efforts during The Great War catapulted Azir Kyp to be one of the age's most popular heroes.
Keeper of the Aureate Rapier
Gold, both color and metal, is an important symbol to the royal family of Kippian. So when Prince Azir stole, or rather in his words "pre-claimed," the Aureate Rapier and rode off to war, the king and his advisors were as worried about the ceremonial artifact as they were of the kingdom's garrulous prince. Soon, however, they realized that the prince's company brought a much needed morale boost to the frontlines—all thanks to the presence of the Gilded Rapier.
Legacy
The second month, Azir, is named after Azir Kyp.
Lore Mentions
Excerpt from Selected Biographies of the Royal Line
It was also said that the young prince is capable of ending a battle even before it started. Such feats are most daring that the readers might assume that most of them are fabricated. This next anecdote, however, is accurate and is substantiated by numerous witnesses.
Once, during a rather uneventful time in the war,  Prince Azir let himself be captured and thrown into an enemy prison camp. Couple of days later, he reappeared with a brag to boot: his captured comrades, along with some new recruits, were with him when he returned. No one seemed to be injured, and all were fitted with the enemies’ weapons and armor. Azir made a seemingly daring prison break, but for him it was just another dare.
