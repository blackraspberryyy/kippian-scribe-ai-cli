Description
This rough, red-hued powder is extremely explosive and flammable. Its crafting process includes infusing blacksand, a less potent natural explosive, with a concoction of alchemical acids and catalysts. Crafting gloompowder devices such as cannons and arquebuses is a niche within smithing circles.

The port of [Curkip imports barrels of gloompowder. During the Curkip Revolt, gloompowder is used as the rebels' choice of firepower.
