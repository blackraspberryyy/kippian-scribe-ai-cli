Description
Amlaena Gustkil is an Ephelian heroine who is notably absent in the annals of The Great War. Chance encounters with her happen only in uneventful marches and in lengthy war council meetings, and even then the lucky witnesses do not notice the unassuming Ethereal Ranger in their midst. Ultimately, the exploits of Amlaena Gustkil are recorded only in shared war lore among soldiers; this is the reason why there are more ballads honoring Amlaena than written records of her deeds.
Keeper of the Evanescent Shortbow
Amlaena Gustkil wields the Evanescent Shortbow which allowed her to slip through enemy lines and sabotage them from the rear. She acted alone, and left no evidence and no witnesses—and this was only possible because of the Evanescent Shortbow.
Legacy
The fourth month, Gustkil, is named after Amlaena Gustkil.
Lore Mentions
Excerpt from Elven Lore: Stories from the Lost War
It was said that Amlaena's Shortbow is translucent in sight. Arrows fired from her shortbow evaporate into thin air, making it impossible for the bow and its wielder to be tracked. A weapon that hides its wielder is quite formidable in the right hands.
–excerpt from Elven Lore: Stories from the Lost War
From a popular bardic song
Without thine light  
Her spirit’s fading into the ethereal  
Find it there; light it back home
–verse from a popular bardic song about Amlaena
