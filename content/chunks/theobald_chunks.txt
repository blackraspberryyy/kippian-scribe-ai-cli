Theobald Clayhollow is an optimistic, delightful, and wholesome elderly cleric who resides in Effil. He has devoted his life to the goddess Aisef, the deity of healing. He used to preach from the Temple of Aisef, but later chose to serve in the Effil Orphanage as a Lifetender, using his divine gifts to heal sick children.

Theobald often tells bedtime stories to the orphans, usually about Aisef. Over time, his stories became repetitive. One night, a little girl in pajamas asked, "Grandpa Theo, do you have any other stories other than the Everhealing Goddess? Maybe something that you did yourself?"

Theobald was born in Yelkor, a town near Curkip. His parents, Theo and Rhela, owned a clayware business. Together with his older brother Theodore, they traveled across Kippian selling pots, bowls, and cups. Theodore led the caravan while Theobald acted as the merchant and speaker.

One fateful journey through the woods, the brothers were attacked by dire wolves. Theodore was severely mauled while protecting their caravan. Theobald, paralyzed by fear, stayed hidden. Desperate, he prayed for help. A divine voice answered: "Theobald, son of Theo, worry not, for I hear you."

The pendant Theobald wore began to glow. He raised his hand, and divine light surged forth, scaring the wolves away. He placed his hand on Theodore's wounds, and they began to heal miraculously. This moment sparked Theobald’s transformation into a devout follower of Aisef.

That night, Theobald received a vision from Aisef. The next morning, he told his parents, “I finally know my purpose. I am going to Effil to preach Aisef. Aisef needs me.” He asked his mother to care for Theodore and left home, setting off to fulfill his divine calling.

Theobald served in Effil for 40 years, preaching, healing, and performing sacred rites in Aisef's name. When an orphanage was built nearby, he began ministering to the children. He became a permanent resident, treating the sick and offering miracles that deepened the children’s faith.

One night, as the little girl begged for a new story, Theobald said, “I haven’t been on an adventure before. But if you brush your teeth and go to bed early, I promise to tell you the most epic story of your life. I’m not sure when, but you’ll be the first to hear it!”

Soon after, Theobald departed for Curkip, seeking his first adventure. Though unsure what trials awaited him, he held strong faith that Aisef would guide his path, just as she had done all those years ago in the forest.
