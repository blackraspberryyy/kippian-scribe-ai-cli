[Chunk 1]
Theobald Clayhollow is an elderly human cleric known for his optimism and wholesome demeanor. He resides in Effil and is recognized as a devout follower of Aisef, the Goddess of Healing.

[Chunk 2]
He once served at the Temple of Aisef in Effil, preaching her words, performing rites, and healing the sick and injured over a span of decades.

[Chunk 3]
Eventually, Theobald moved to the Effil Orphanage to become a Lifetender, focusing his healing abilities on caring for sick and injured children.

[Chunk 4]
In his role at the orphanage, Theobald would tell bedtime stories about Aisef and her teachings to inspire the children.

[Chunk 5]
Over time, the stories he told became repetitive to the children, leading them to ask for new tales.

[Chunk 6]
One night, a little girl in pajamas asked him if he had any stories of his own adventures, rather than just stories about Aisef.

[Chunk 7]
Theobald replied that he had never been on an adventure but promised to tell her the most epic story of her life someday.

[Chunk 8]
Theobald’s origins trace back to Yelkor, a town on the outskirts of Curkip.

[Chunk 9]
His parents, Theo and Rhela Clayhollow, ran a successful clayware business selling pots, bowls, and cups.

[Chunk 10]
Theobald and his older brother Theodore helped in the family business as traveling merchants.

[Chunk 11]
Theodore would helm the caravan while Theobald sold goods to locals during their travels.

[Chunk 12]
The business required frequent travel around Kippian, sometimes without their father accompanying them.

[Chunk 13]
While traveling south of the Yorvengarde Mountains, the brothers encountered a pack of hungry dire wolves.

[Chunk 14]
The wolves attacked, targeting Theodore’s horse and causing both to fall to the ground.

[Chunk 15]
Half the wolves attacked Theodore while the others tore into the horse.

[Chunk 16]
The wolves ripped off Theodore’s right leg and arm, carrying the arm away like a trophy.

[Chunk 17]
Theobald stayed hidden inside the caravan during the attack, terrified and unsure what to do.

[Chunk 18]
In desperation, Theobald prayed for relief for his brother, calling out to any who would hear.

[Chunk 19]
A female voice answered his prayer, assuring him she had heard him.

[Chunk 20]
Theobald realized he was holding a glowing pendant with a curious symbol.

[Chunk 21]
Divine energy traveled from the pendant into his hand.

[Chunk 22]
He raised his hand, releasing a burst of bright light that scared away the wolves.

[Chunk 23]
Theobald placed his hand on Theodore’s wounds, which sealed instantly through divine healing.

[Chunk 24]
Carrying Theodore back to Yelkor, Theobald entrusted his brother to the care of their parents.

[Chunk 25]
That night, Theobald received a vision from Aisef, revealing his purpose.

[Chunk 26]
He told his parents that Aisef had relieved Theodore’s pain and that he must go to Effil to serve her.

[Chunk 27]
For forty years, Theobald served at the Temple of Aisef, preaching, healing, and making offerings.

[Chunk 28]
When an orphanage was built near the temple, he began preaching to the children there.

[Chunk 29]
The children at the orphanage often witnessed his divine miracles, strengthening their faith.

[Chunk 30]
Over time, Theobald decided to live permanently at the orphanage to better care for the children.

[Chunk 31]
Theobald found joy and fulfillment in his life at the orphanage.

[Chunk 32]
The little girl’s request for new stories inspired him to leave Effil in search of adventure.

[Chunk 33]
He traveled to Curkip without knowing exactly what ordeals awaited him, confident Aisef would guide him.

[Chunk 34]
Theobald’s family includes his parents, Theo and Rhela Clayhollow, and his brother Theodore.

[Chunk 35]
He is a member of the adventuring group “Seven Up,” which includes Adikia Unalome, Adeena Oberon, Arc, Thoradin Goodman, Noah Skie, Kiris Acquermann, and Splix.

[Chunk 36]
In his adventures, Theobald has healed civilians, including using Lesser Restoration to save eight Yvernus District residents.

[Chunk 37]
He has assisted in major events such as solving riddles that revealed hidden passages.

[Chunk 38]
During one mission, he offered Matunda’s Mace to a sphinx in exchange for the party’s freedom.

[Chunk 39]
The sphinx accepted the offer but only freed Theobald, Splix, and Fiamil.

[Chunk 40]
Arc later recovered Matunda’s Mace along with other treasures.

[Chunk 41]
Theobald has cast Revivify on fallen comrades, including Dorfir Embersense and Fiamil Underwood.

[Chunk 42]
He used Stone Shape to repair cracks in a petrified statue.

[Chunk 43]
He has participated in large-scale construction efforts, such as helping to build an airship.

[Chunk 44]
Theobald has faced moments of doubt and conflict in his faith.

[Chunk 45]
In a vision, he saw Aisef in deep conflict, kneeling before a shrine in an open field.

[Chunk 46]
A mysterious woman appeared to Aisef, offering words that mirrored divine whispers Theobald had heard.

[Chunk 47]
The woman bore the symbol of Matunda, the Old God of life and death.

[Chunk 48]
She told Theobald, “The truth will set you free. You are destined for greater things.”

[Chunk 49]
Theobald shared this vision with Father Ignatius, expressing his uncertainty about his path.

[Chunk 50]
Despite moments of doubt, Theobald continues to serve Aisef while pursuing the truth about his destiny.
