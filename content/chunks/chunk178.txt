Description
Rickard is the youngest of the two sons of King Riordan. Rickard appears to be aloof and follows the lead of his older brother.

As the younger brother of Remus, Rickard has little chance of being the Kingdom of United Kippian. Yet Rickard covets the throne. This jealousy led Rickard to be in league with The Cult of Miledu. Rickard appears in the Theater Incident as the representative wearing Ankyra's ring.

During the party's investigations of the Death of King Riordan, Rickard is revealed to be the assassin of King Riordan. He used the Aureate Rapier to kill the King.
