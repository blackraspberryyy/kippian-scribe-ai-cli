Fulfilling an Oath
[Adeena's Survey
Adeena surveys the Ironfleet Compound and found Dusk Talons planning to assault it.
Adeena heard a booming sound; she investigates it and sees that it was the main gate of the compound destroyed.
Adeena sees Gandour directing his men to guard the breached gate.
Adeena realizes that the breach is a distraction to weaken the compound's defenses at other points.
While resting, Adeena is attacked. It is revealed to be "Candor," Frederick's right hand man.
"Finally, I see you again, Adeena."
Inside the Carriage...
Meanwhile, within the carriage, Kayriel's body melts.
"You really think it would be that easy?"
Splix casts Locate Creature, and finds a similar creature near the Ironfleet Compound.
The party, minus Adeena, rushes to the compound.
The Party Rescues Adeena...  
There, they saw Adeena surrendering to a man hidden behind the shadows.
Adikia rushes forwards and attempts to grab the man. Adikia fails; however, she figures out that the man Adeena is surrendering to is Kayriel, or at least resembles its face.
The party decides to confront Kayriel.
Arc climbs the nearby structure and finds three Dusk Talons overlooking the Compound.
Kayriel is defeated; however, it turns out that it is not the real body of Kayriel either. The body melts again, as the illusion bids another warning.
"We shall meet again, Adeena."
The party observes the Dusk Talons withdrawing from the compound.
