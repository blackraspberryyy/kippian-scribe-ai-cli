Description
A gladiator turned general, Johannes Cappodon is hailed as the most indomitable hero of the Kippian-Sumber War. Clad in all-defensive gear, the general is able to protect whole retinues from ambushes and untoward attacks. His heroic deeds earned him the fitting designation as the Shield of Kippian.
Keeper of the Vambrace Shields
United Kippian's most celebrated war general, Johannes Cappodon, donned the Vambrace Shields, a singular combination that allowed him unrivaled protection on the battlefield. But the reasoning behind dual-wielding shields was not to protect himself; more importantly for him, it was a tool to defend his allies. It was an unusual way of leading an army, but being under the general's protection provided security and morale to his companions.
Legacy
The seventh month, Cappodon, is named after Johannes Cappodon.
Lore Mentions
Excerpt from Chronicles of the Kippian-Sumber War
“That man is not a fighter… That man is a protector—and if he is loyal to a cause, a reliable ally. Release him, and bring him to me. I have yet to find a man as unyielding as that gladiator.”
–King Agustus Kyp
Even when he was just a gladiator, Johannes Cappodon never had an inclination to an aggressive way of fighting. Armed with a singular buckler and a dull blade, he defended and wore down his opponents. His bouts were feats of stamina—his enemies conceding due to fatigue, with Johannes outlasting all fighters in the arena.
One summer night, the audience was understandably bored waiting for Johannes’ protracted duel to end. However, a young prince seated in the royal balcony was delighted about the warrior’s inane display of defense. That prince soon became King Agustus Kyp, and he brought with him the loyal gladiator who became one of the most important figures of the great Kippian-Sumber War
