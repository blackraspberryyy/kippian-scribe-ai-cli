Description
The desert nomads of Opidys are known for their reckless and aggressive use of arcane power. Zerrus Zagi, the Grand Magus of Opidys, was said to be the epitome of an Opidian mage. His arcane mastery garnered enough reputation even among the high elven mages of Ephelus who were considered to be the authority on all forms of magic.

During The Great War, King Agustus bid for the service of the Grand Magus in exchange for the liberation of the lands of Opidys. It was an unpopular decision, but it soon proved to be the correct one: Zerrus Zagi returned to Kippian a hero, and in time a loyal ally, of the King of United Kippian and its people.
Keeper of the Ymerald Staff
Zagi was able to call on the power of the skies and stars by channeling his arcane energy through the Ymerald Staff. The Ymerald Staff, which was found deep within the Lake of Shimmers, was imbued with great power both earthly and otherworldly. Only Zagi had the strength and wits to control such maddening power. During The Great War, it became obvious that Zerrus Zagi, the Ymerald Evoker, is among the greatest wizards who have ever lived.
Legacy
The sixth month, Zagi, is named after Zerrus Zagi.
Lore Mentions
Excerpt from the Magi of Opidys
"Magus Zagi is worth a whole army. If need be, give in to his demands. We have a war to win."
–King Agustus Kyp

For a time Zerrus Zagi was known to be a mad wizard. Kippians were wary of the Opidians and their magic: it was irregular, and in some cases even cultic. Zagi was the Grand Magus of Opidys, and mages from all over Kippian who dared to subdue Zagi went back humbled by the Opidian mage.
But the great war came, and the elven leaders of Ephelus decided to seek the help of the Opidians. Through King Agustus, Zagi gained Opidys its sovereignty in exchange for his service in the war. There were doubts, especially from the elven warmages, but the moment Zagi descended from the Kippian ship, the tide of war began to shift. All doubts were erased: the Ymerald Evoker was worth much, much more than what he had bargained for.
