Session 52: Along the way, the party spots the Bloated Dragon. They manage to catch its attention, thanks to a loud roar from Dorfir Embersense.
Session 52: The Bloated Dragon descends, and Gandour Ironfleet meets them. He explains that the party was gone for nearly two days. The party concludes that entering the Library must have induced another temporal anomaly.

"Lucky that you are all alive..."
