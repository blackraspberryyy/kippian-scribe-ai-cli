Description
The Evershift is a sword of intricate dwarven design and ingenuity. Internal counterweight mechanisms allow the sword to shift its apparent weight, making it unwieldy to the uninitiated but a fearsome weapon to a trained one. Finally, Mathudim's design renders the Evershift durable and protected to disassembly, as if a magic weapon.
Mythic Keeper: Mathudim Strongbolt
The Evershift is created and wielded by Mathudim during The Great War. The weapon gave Mathudim a unique style of fighting, one that is seemingly unbeatable and adaptable to any battle.
