Description
Chtapodhi district is renowned across all of Kippian as the district with the best shipbuilders. Seafarers, merchants, and immigrants compose the majority of the district's population.

The land where the district is located is reclaimed from the sea. Canals and waterways serve as secondary transportation channels. Bridges of all kinds stitch the artificial islands together.

Clan Ironfleet oversees the district. Shemance Ironfleet is the district's High Council representative.
