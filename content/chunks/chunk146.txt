Description
Yugad was a young assistant cleric when he was drawn into The Great War. There he realized a truth most clerics never understood: the indivisibility of life and death. For one to live, one shall die. For Yugad, to merely witness death without any concern for the living is reviling and intolerable. And the reverse is also true: to contemplate life to the fullest, one must also invite death.

Yugad left the order and actively engaged in frontline skirmishes. He killed as he healed, an act which was deemed barbaric by the unsullied clerics. Armed with his newfound wisdom, it became clear to Yugad that he has powers no dogmatic cleric has ever had. In time, Yugad became known as the only life and death cleric to ever exist: he became Matunda's Amalgam Cleric.
Keeper of Matunda's Mace
As a devoted healing cleric thrust into the middle of a bloody, Yugad painfully learned the rationale for violence. Through his soul-powered Matunda's Mace, he inflicted death and gave forth healing.
Legacy
The tenth and final month, Yugad, is named after Yugad Matunda.
Lore Mentions
Excerpt from Collected Learnings from Yugad Matunda
Death and life are not the same thing, but to separate one from the other is a folly—a shortsighted and self-serving perspective. There is no other way around it: to bring forth death is to raise life. This amalgamation of death and life is central to understanding true divine power; a hard, unconscionable truth, but a truth nonetheless.
–excerpt from Collected Learnings from Yugad Matunda
Excerpt from Touched by the Divine
While most orders dismiss Matunda’s teaching as either barbaric or paradoxical, it nevertheless had an undeniable influence on the discourse of divine power. It was due to Yugad's brazen belief that allowed for the possibility of non-traditional access to divine power.
